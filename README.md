# RAFLAB

If you're part of an anti-rip thing, ooga booga scary rippers use this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Remember to laugh and point or something idk.. or say something about how shit my code is, gets me working. Remember, bullying works! üëç Without bullying, or me trying to prove someone wrong, and months of work, this wouldn't exist so remember that... your bullying helped this project!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OOGA BOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for edging me (sexually) I love you Kanna, notcake, PlagueVRC (retired) and everyone who activley uses anti-rip (us fr fr -> (üíèüíèüíèüíè)

RAFLAB is still under development at the moment so if an issue occurs create a new issue about it and I'll look into it

RAFLAB is also very unoptimized at the moment, I plan to optimize code as much as possible in the future

RAFLAB was made by me (qkms) and liamriley101

RAFLAB (Recreate Avatar From Loaded Asset Bundle)

RAFLAB lets you take a vrca loaded asset bundle from FACS01 load bundle (https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities) and make get it to project state without ripping it with an asset ripper.

Animation file copying is not supported at the moment as it's impoosible to recreate animations from loaded asset bundles

This tool is mainly used to rip anti rip avatars that break any asset ripper directly, or get turned into corrupt assets when ripped, other anti rips that mess with the mesh vertices and such are not going to be fixed with this method

As of right now (10/13/2023) There's alot of bugs that need to be fixed, but it's in a mostly working state.

Known Issues (Not bugs, issues):
1. If a material uses multiple of the same texture, it'll copy all textures as if they are different, same with other materials using the same texture, so you can get multiple copies of the same texture

2. Audios do not like to be put back into place automatically for some reason

3. Animation copying is not possible at the moment

4. If the folder you're copying materials too already has copied materials, the new materials will lose their references to both textures and shaders making them purple

5. If multiple meshes use the same material, you'll end up with multiple of the same material as their own seperate material
