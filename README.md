# RAFLAB

RAFLAB is a tool I made that takes a loaded asset bundle and turns that bundle into a working project.

Use [FACS01](https://github.com/FACS01-01/FACS_Utilities) loadbundle to load in a bundle into unity and then use RAFLAB to get the assets from the bundle

Known Issues (Not bugs, issues):

1. Audios do not like to be put back into place automatically for some reason

2. Animation copying is not possible at the moment

3. If the folder you're copying materials too already has copied materials, the new materials will lose their references to both textures and shaders making them purple
