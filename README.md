# RAFLAB
Known Issues (Not bugs, issues):

1. Audios do not like to be put back into place automatically for some reason

2. Animation copying is not possible at the moment

3. If the folder you're copying materials too already has copied materials, the new materials will lose their references to both textures and shaders making them purple
